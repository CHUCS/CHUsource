			<p>You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.</p>
<p>Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.</p>
<p>Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).</p>
<p>Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?<br>
=======
			<p>Valeric and Valerko missed the last Euro football game, so they decided to watch the game’s key moments on the Net. They want to start watching as soon as possible but the connection speed is too low. If they turn on the video right now, it will “hang up” as the size of data to watch per second will be more than the size of downloaded data per second.</p>
<p>The guys want to watch the whole video without any pauses, so they have to wait some integer number of seconds for a part of the video to download. After this number of seconds passes, they can start watching. Waiting for the whole video to download isn’t necessary as the video can download after the guys started to watch.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose that video’s length is c seconds and Valeric and Valerko wait t seconds before the watching. Then for any moment of time t<sub>0</sub>, t ≤ t<sub>0</sub> ≤ c + t, the following condition must fulfill: the size of data received in t<sub>0</sub> seconds is not less than the size of data needed to watch t<sub>0</sub> - t seconds of the video.</p>
<p>Of course, the guys want to wait as little as possible, so your task is to find the minimum integer number of seconds to wait before turning the video on. The guys must watch the video without pauses.</p>

			<p>Arkady wants to water his only flower. Unfortunately, he has a very poor watering system that was designed for n flowers and so it looks like a pipe with n holes. Arkady can only use the water that flows from the first hole.</p>
<p>Arkady can block some of the holes, and then pour A liters of water into the pipe. After that, the water will flow out from the non-blocked holes proportionally to their sizes s<sub>1</sub>,s<sub>2</sub>,…,s<sub>n</sub>. In other words, if the sum of sizes of non-blocked holes is S, and the i-th hole is not blocked, (s<sub>i</sub>*A)/S liters of water will flow out of it.</p>
<p>What is the minimum number of holes Arkady should block to make at least B liters of water flow out of the first hole?</p>

			<p>A frog is currently at the point 0 on a coordinate axis Ox. It jumps by the following algorithm: the first jump is a units to the right, the second jump is b units to the left, the third jump is a units to the right, the fourth jump is b units to the left, and so on.</p>
<p>Formally:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>● if the frog has jumped an even number of times (before the current jump), it jumps from its current position x to position x+a;<br>● otherwise it jumps from its current position x to position x−b.<br>Your task is to calculate the position of the frog after k jumps.</p>

<p>In one second we can add an arbitrary (possibly negative) integer to all elements of the array that are not equal to zero.<br>When all elements of the array become equal to zero, the array explodes.<br>Nastya is always busy, so she wants to explode the array as fast as possible. Compute the minimum time in which the array can be exploded.</p>

			<p>Mad scientist Mike entertains himself by arranging rows of dominoes. He doesn’t need dominoes, though: he uses rectangular magnets instead. Each magnet has two poles, positive (a “plus”) and negative (a “minus”). If two magnets are put together at a close distance, then the like poles will repel each other and the opposite poles will attract each other.</p>
<p>Mike starts by laying one magnet horizontally on the table. During each following step Mike adds one more magnet horizontally to the right end of the row. Depending on how Mike puts the magnet on the table, it is either attracted to the previous one (forming a group of multiple magnets linked together) or repelled by it (then Mike lays this magnet at some distance to the right from the previous one). We assume that a sole magnet not linked to others forms a group of its own.<br><img src="A.PNG" alt="A"><br>Mike arranged multiple magnets in a row. Determine the number of groups that the magnets formed.<br>

			<p>Ilya is a very clever lion, he lives in an unusual city ZooVille. In this city all the animals have their rights and obligations. Moreover, they even have their own bank accounts. The state of a bank account is an integer. The state of a bank account can be a negative number. This means that the owner of the account owes the bank money.</p>
<p>Ilya the Lion has recently had a birthday, so he got a lot of gifts. One of them (the gift of the main ZooVille bank) is the opportunity to delete the last digit or the digit before last from the state of his bank account no more than once. For example, if the state of Ilya’s bank account is -123, then Ilya can delete the last digit and get his account balance equal to -12, also he can remove its digit before last and get the account balance equal to -13. Of course, Ilya is permitted not to use the opportunity to delete a digit from the balance.</p>
<p>Ilya is not very good at math, and that’s why he asks you to help him maximize his bank account. Find the maximum state of the bank account that can be obtained using the bank’s gift.</p>

			<p>Little Petya very much likes gifts. Recently he has received a new laptop as a New Year gift from his mother. He immediately decided to give it to somebody else as what can be more pleasant than giving somebody gifts. And on this occasion he organized a New Year party at his place and invited n his friends there.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing Petya likes more that receiving gifts, that’s watching others giving gifts to somebody else. Thus, he safely hid the laptop until the next New Year and made up his mind to watch his friends exchanging gifts while he does not participate in the process. He numbered all his friends with integers from 1 to n. Petya remembered that a friend number i gave a gift to a friend number p<sub>i</sub>. He also remembered that each of his friends received exactly one gift.</p>
<p>Now Petya wants to know for each friend i the number of a friend who has given him a gift.</p>

			<p>Eugeny loves listening to music. He has n songs in his play list. We know that song number i has the duration of t<sub>i</sub> minutes. Eugeny listens to each song, perhaps more than once. He listens to song number i c<sub>i</sub> times. Eugeny’s play list is organized as follows: first song number 1 plays c<sub>1</sub> times, then song number 2 plays c<sub>2</sub> times, …, in the end the song number n plays cn times.</p>
<p>Eugeny took a piece of paper and wrote out m moments of time when he liked a song. Now for each such moment he wants to know the number of the song that played at that moment. The moment x means that Eugeny wants to know which song was playing during the x-th minute of his listening to the play list.</p>
<p>Help Eugeny and calculate the required numbers of songs.<br>

			<p>Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw n squares in the snow with a side length of 1. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length 1, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.</p>
<p>In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends (x,y)and (x,y+1). Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends (x′,y) and (x′,y+1) for some x′. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates x, x+1 and the differing coordinate y.</p>

			<p>Valeric and Valerko missed the last Euro football game, so they decided to watch the game’s key moments on the Net. They want to start watching as soon as possible but the connection speed is too low. If they turn on the video right now, it will “hang up” as the size of data to watch per second will be more than the size of downloaded data per second.</p>
<p>The guys want to watch the whole video without any pauses, so they have to wait some integer number of seconds for a part of the video to download. After this number of seconds passes, they can start watching. Waiting for the whole video to download isn’t necessary as the video can download after the guys started to watch.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose that video’s length is c seconds and Valeric and Valerko wait t seconds before the watching. Then for any moment of time t<sub>0</sub>, t ≤ t<sub>0</sub> ≤ c + t, the following condition must fulfill: the size of data received in t<sub>0</sub> seconds is not less than the size of data needed to watch t<sub>0</sub> - t seconds of the video.</p>
<p>Of course, the guys want to wait as little as possible, so your task is to find the minimum integer number of seconds to wait before turning the video on. The guys must watch the video without pauses.<br>

			<p>Vasiliy likes to rest after a hard work, so you may often meet him in some bar nearby. As all programmers do, he loves the famous drink “Beecola”, which can be bought in n different shops in the city. It’s known that the price of one bottle in the shop i is equal to x<sub>i</sub> coins.</p>
<p>Vasiliy plans to buy his favorite drink for q consecutive days. He knows, that on the i-th day he will be able to spent m<sub>i</sub> coins. Now, for each of the days he want to know in how many different shops he can buy a bottle of “Beecola”.</p>

			<p>Arkady wants to water his only flower. Unfortunately, he has a very poor watering system that was designed for n flowers and so it looks like a pipe with n holes. Arkady can only use the water that flows from the first hole.</p>
<p>Arkady can block some of the holes, and then pour A liters of water into the pipe. After that, the water will flow out from the non-blocked holes proportionally to their sizes s<sub>1</sub>,s<sub>2</sub>,…,s<sub>n</sub>. In other words, if the sum of sizes of non-blocked holes is S, and the i-th hole is not blocked, (s<sub>i</sub>*A)/S liters of water will flow out of it.</p>
<p>What is the minimum number of holes Arkady should block to make at least B liters of water flow out of the first hole?<br>
=======
			<p>Arkady invited Anna for a dinner to a sushi restaurant. The restaurant is a bit unusual: it offers n pieces of sushi aligned in a row, and a customer has to choose a continuous subsegment of these sushi to buy.</p>
<p>The pieces of sushi are of two types: either with tuna or with eel. Let’s denote the type of the i-th from the left sushi as t<sub>i</sub>, where t<sub>i</sub>=1 means it is with tuna, and t<sub>i</sub>=2 means it is with eel.</p>
<p>Arkady does not like tuna, Anna does not like eel. Arkady wants to choose such a continuous subsegment of sushi that it has equal number of sushi of each type and each half of the subsegment has only sushi of one type. For example, subsegment [2,2,2,1,1,1] is valid, but subsegment [1,2,1,2,1,2] is not, because both halves contain both types of sushi.</p>
<p>Find the length of the longest continuous subsegment of sushi Arkady can buy.</p>

			<p>Nastya owns too many arrays now, so she wants to delete the least important of them. However, she discovered that this array is magic! Nastya now knows that the array has the following properties:</p>
<p>In one second we can add an arbitrary (possibly negative) integer to all elements of the array that are not equal to zero.<br>When all elements of the array become equal to zero, the array explodes.<br>Nastya is always busy, so she wants to explode the array as fast as possible. Compute the minimum time in which the array can be exploded.<br>

			<p>Maxim always goes to the supermarket on Sundays. Today the supermarket has a special offer of discount systems.</p>
<p>There are m types of discounts. We assume that the discounts are indexed from 1 to m. To use the discount number i, the customer takes a special basket, where he puts exactly q<sub>i</sub> items he buys. Under the terms of the discount system, in addition to the items in the cart the customer can receive at most two items from the supermarket for free. The number of the “free items” (0, 1 or 2) to give is selected by the customer. The only condition imposed on the selected “free items” is as follows: each of them mustn’t be more expensive than the cheapest item out of the q<sub>i</sub> items in the cart.</p>
<p>Maxim now needs to buy n items in the shop. Count the minimum sum of money that Maxim needs to buy them, if he use the discount system optimally well.</p>
<p>Please assume that the supermarket has enough carts for any actions. Maxim can use the same discount multiple times. Of course, Maxim can buy items without any discounts.</p>

			<p>Ilya is a very clever lion, he lives in an unusual city ZooVille. In this city all the animals have their rights and obligations. Moreover, they even have their own bank accounts. The state of a bank account is an integer. The state of a bank account can be a negative number. This means that the owner of the account owes the bank money.</p>
<p>Ilya the Lion has recently had a birthday, so he got a lot of gifts. One of them (the gift of the main ZooVille bank) is the opportunity to delete the last digit or the digit before last from the state of his bank account no more than once. For example, if the state of Ilya’s bank account is -123, then Ilya can delete the last digit and get his account balance equal to -12, also he can remove its digit before last and get the account balance equal to -13. Of course, Ilya is permitted not to use the opportunity to delete a digit from the balance.</p>
<p>Ilya is not very good at math, and that’s why he asks you to help him maximize his bank account. Find the maximum state of the bank account that can be obtained using the bank’s gift.<br>
=======
			<p>Ivan has n songs on his phone. The size of the i-th song is a<sub>i</sub> bytes. Ivan also has a flash drive which can hold at most m bytes in total. Initially, his flash drive is empty.</p>
<p>Ivan wants to copy all n songs to the flash drive. He can compress the songs. If he compresses the i-th song, the size of the i-th song reduces from a<sub>i</sub> to b<sub>i</sub> bytes (b<sub>i</sub> &lt; a<sub>i</sub>).</p>
<p>Ivan can compress any subset of the songs (possibly empty) and copy all the songs to his flash drive if the sum of their sizes is at most m. He can compress any subset of the songs (not necessarily contiguous).</p>
<p>Ivan wants to find the minimum number of songs he needs to compress in such a way that all his songs fit on the drive (i.e. the sum of their sizes is less than or equal to m).</p>
<p>If it is impossible to copy all the songs (even if Ivan compresses all the songs), print “-1”. Otherwise print the minimum number of songs Ivan needs to compress.</p>
