			<p>Masha wants to open her own bakery and bake muffins in one of the n cities numbered from 1 to n. There are m bidirectional roads, each of whose connects some pair of cities.</p>
<p>To bake muffins in her bakery, Masha needs to establish flour supply from some storage. There are only k storages, located in different cities numbered a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, …, a<sub>k</sub>.</p>
<p>Unforunately the law of the country Masha lives in prohibits opening bakery in any of the cities which has storage located in it. She can open it only in one of another n - k cities, and, of course, flour delivery should be paid — for every kilometer of path between storage and bakery Masha should pay 1 ruble.</p>
<p>Formally, Masha will pay x roubles, if she will open the bakery in some city b (a<sub>i</sub> ≠ b for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k) and choose a storage in some city s (s = aj for some 1 ≤ j ≤ k) and b and s are connected by some path of roads of summary length x (if there are more than one path, Masha is able to choose which of them should be used).</p>
<p>Masha is very thrifty and rational. She is interested in a city, where she can open her bakery (and choose one of k storages and one of the paths between city with bakery and city with storage) and pay minimum possible amount of rubles for flour delivery. Please help Masha find this amount.</p>

			<p>The capital of Berland has n multifloor buildings. The architect who built up the capital was very creative, so all the houses were built in one row.</p>
<p>Let’s enumerate all the houses from left to right, starting with one. A house is considered to be luxurious if the number of floors in it is strictly greater than in all the houses with larger numbers. In other words, a house is luxurious if the number of floors in it is strictly greater than in all the houses, which are located to the right from it. In this task it is assumed that the heights of floors in the houses are the same.</p>
<p>The new architect is interested in n questions, i-th of them is about the following: “how many floors should be added to the i-th house to make it luxurious?” (for all i from 1 to n, inclusive). You need to help him cope with this task.</p>
<p>Note that all these questions are independent from each other — the answer to the question for house i does not affect other answers (i.e., the floors to the houses are not actually added).</p>

			<p>Alice has a birthday today, so she invited home her best friend Bob. Now Bob needs to find a way to commute to the Alice’s home.</p>
<p>In the city in which Alice and Bob live, the first metro line is being built. This metro line contains n<br>stations numbered from 1 to n. Bob lives near the station with number 1, while Alice lives near the station with number s. The metro line has two tracks. Trains on the first track go from the station 1 to the station n</p>
<p>and trains on the second track go in reverse direction. Just after the train arrives to the end of its track, it goes to the depot immediately, so it is impossible to travel on it after that.</p>
<p>Some stations are not yet open at all and some are only partially open — for each station and for each track it is known whether the station is closed for that track or not. If a station is closed for some track, all trains going in this track’s direction pass the station without stopping on it.</p>
<p>When the Bob got the information on opened and closed stations, he found that traveling by metro may be unexpectedly complicated. Help Bob determine whether he can travel to the Alice’s home by metro or he should search for some other transport.</p>
