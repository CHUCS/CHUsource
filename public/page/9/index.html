			<p>Valeric and Valerko missed the last Euro football game, so they decided to watch the game’s key moments on the Net. They want to start watching as soon as possible but the connection speed is too low. If they turn on the video right now, it will “hang up” as the size of data to watch per second will be more than the size of downloaded data per second.</p>
<p>The guys want to watch the whole video without any pauses, so they have to wait some integer number of seconds for a part of the video to download. After this number of seconds passes, they can start watching. Waiting for the whole video to download isn’t necessary as the video can download after the guys started to watch.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose that video’s length is c seconds and Valeric and Valerko wait t seconds before the watching. Then for any moment of time t<sub>0</sub>, t ≤ t<sub>0</sub> ≤ c + t, the following condition must fulfill: the size of data received in t<sub>0</sub> seconds is not less than the size of data needed to watch t<sub>0</sub> - t seconds of the video.</p>
<p>Of course, the guys want to wait as little as possible, so your task is to find the minimum integer number of seconds to wait before turning the video on. The guys must watch the video without pauses.</p>

			<p>Arkady wants to water his only flower. Unfortunately, he has a very poor watering system that was designed for n flowers and so it looks like a pipe with n holes. Arkady can only use the water that flows from the first hole.</p>

After that, the water will flow out from the non-blocked holes proportionally to their sizes s<sub>1</sub>,s<sub>2</sub>,…,s<sub>n</sub>.

			<p>Ilya is a very clever lion, he lives in an unusual city ZooVille. In this city all the animals have their rights and obligations. Moreover, they even have their own bank accounts. The state of a bank account is an integer. The state of a bank account can be a negative number. This means that the owner of the account owes the bank money.</p>
<p>Ilya the Lion has recently had a birthday, so he got a lot of gifts. One of them (the gift of the main ZooVille bank) is the opportunity to delete the last digit or the digit before last from the state of his bank account no more than once. For example, if the state of Ilya’s bank account is -123, then Ilya can delete the last digit and get his account balance equal to -12, also he can remove its digit before last and get the account balance equal to -13. Of course, Ilya is permitted not to use the opportunity to delete a digit from the balance.</p>
<p>Ilya is not very good at math, and that’s why he asks you to help him maximize his bank account. Find the maximum state of the bank account that can be obtained using the bank’s gift.</p>

			<p>Little Petya very much likes gifts. Recently he has received a new laptop as a New Year gift from his mother. He immediately decided to give it to somebody else as what can be more pleasant than giving somebody gifts. And on this occasion he organized a New Year party at his place and invited n his friends there.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing Petya likes more that receiving gifts, that’s watching others giving gifts to somebody else. Thus, he safely hid the laptop until the next New Year and made up his mind to watch his friends exchanging gifts while he does not participate in the process. He numbered all his friends with integers from 1 to n. Petya remembered that a friend number i gave a gift to a friend number p<sub>i</sub>. He also remembered that each of his friends received exactly one gift.</p>
<p>Now Petya wants to know for each friend i the number of a friend who has given him a gift.</p>

			<p>Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw n squares in the snow with a side length of 1. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length 1, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.</p>
<p>In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends (x,y)and (x,y+1). Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends (x′,y) and (x′,y+1) for some x′. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates x, x+1 and the differing coordinate y.</p>

			<p>Arkady invited Anna for a dinner to a sushi restaurant. The restaurant is a bit unusual: it offers n pieces of sushi aligned in a row, and a customer has to choose a continuous subsegment of these sushi to buy.</p>
<p>The pieces of sushi are of two types: either with tuna or with eel. Let’s denote the type of the i-th from the left sushi as t<sub>i</sub>, where t<sub>i</sub>=1 means it is with tuna, and t<sub>i</sub>=2 means it is with eel.</p>
<p>Arkady does not like tuna, Anna does not like eel. Arkady wants to choose such a continuous subsegment of sushi that it has equal number of sushi of each type and each half of the subsegment has only sushi of one type. For example, subsegment [2,2,2,1,1,1] is valid, but subsegment [1,2,1,2,1,2] is not, because both halves contain both types of sushi.</p>
<p>Find the length of the longest continuous subsegment of sushi Arkady can buy.</p>
