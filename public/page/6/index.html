			<p>Kirito is stuck on a level of the MMORPG he is playing now. To move on in the game, he’s got to defeat all n dragons that live on this level. Kirito and the dragons have strength, which is represented by an integer. In the duel between two opponents the duel’s outcome is determined by their strength. Initially, Kirito’s strength equals s.</p>
<p>If Kirito starts duelling with the i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ n) dragon and Kirito’s strength is not greater than the dragon’s strength x<sub>i</sub>, then Kirito loses the duel and dies. But if Kirito’s strength is greater than the dragon’s strength, then he defeats the dragon and gets a bonus strength increase by y<sub>i</sub>.</p>
<p>Kirito can fight the dragons in any order. Determine whether he can move on to the next level of the game, that is, defeat all dragons without a single loss.<br>

			<p>Everybody in Russia uses Gregorian calendar. In this calendar there are 31 days in January, 28 or 29 days in February (depending on whether the year is leap or not), 31 days in March, 30 days in April, 31 days in May, 30 in June, 31 in July, 31 in August, 30 in September, 31 in October, 30 in November, 31 in December.</p>
<p>A year is leap in one of two cases: either its number is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, or is divisible by 400. For example, the following years are leap: 2000, 2004, but years 1900 and 2018 are not leap.</p>
<p>In this problem you are given n (1 ≤ n ≤ 24) integers a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, …, a<sub>n</sub>, and you have to check if these integers could be durations in days of n consecutive months, according to Gregorian calendar. Note that these months could belong to several consecutive years. In other words, check if there is a month in some year, such that its duration is a<sub>1</sub> days, duration of the next month is a<sub>2</sub> days, and so on.<br>

			<p>You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.</p>
<p>Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.</p>
<p>Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).</p>
<p>Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?<br>

			<p>Mad scientist Mike entertains himself by arranging rows of dominoes. He doesn’t need dominoes, though: he uses rectangular magnets instead. Each magnet has two poles, positive (a “plus”) and negative (a “minus”). If two magnets are put together at a close distance, then the like poles will repel each other and the opposite poles will attract each other.</p>
<p>Mike starts by laying one magnet horizontally on the table. During each following step Mike adds one more magnet horizontally to the right end of the row. Depending on how Mike puts the magnet on the table, it is either attracted to the previous one (forming a group of multiple magnets linked together) or repelled by it (then Mike lays this magnet at some distance to the right from the previous one). We assume that a sole magnet not linked to others forms a group of its own.<br><img src="A.PNG" alt="A"><br>Mike arranged multiple magnets in a row.

			<p>Valeric and Valerko missed the last Euro football game, so they decided to watch the game’s key moments on the Net. They want to start watching as soon as possible but the connection speed is too low. If they turn on the video right now, it will “hang up” as the size of data to watch per second will be more than the size of downloaded data per second.</p>
<p>The guys want to watch the whole video without any pauses, so they have to wait some integer number of seconds for a part of the video to download. After this number of seconds passes, they can start watching. Waiting for the whole video to download isn’t necessary as the video can download after the guys started to watch.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose that video’s length is c seconds and Valeric and Valerko wait t seconds before the watching. Then for any moment of time t<sub>0</sub>, t ≤ t<sub>0</sub> ≤ c + t, the following condition must fulfill: the size of data received in t<sub>0</sub> seconds is not less than the size of data needed to watch t<sub>0</sub> - t seconds of the video.</p>
<p>Of course, the guys want to wait as little as possible, so your task is to find the minimum integer number of seconds to wait before turning the video on. The guys must watch the video without pauses.<br>
