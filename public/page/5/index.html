			<p>The capital of Berland has n multifloor buildings. The architect who built up the capital was very creative, so all the houses were built in one row.</p>
<p>Let’s enumerate all the houses from left to right, starting with one. A house is considered to be luxurious if the number of floors in it is strictly greater than in all the houses with larger numbers. In other words, a house is luxurious if the number of floors in it is strictly greater than in all the houses, which are located to the right from it. In this task it is assumed that the heights of floors in the houses are the same.</p>
<p>The new architect is interested in n questions, i-th of them is about the following: “how many floors should be added to the i-th house to make it luxurious?” (for all i from 1 to n, inclusive). You need to help him cope with this task.</p>
<p>Note that all these questions are independent from each other — the answer to the question for house i does not affect other answers (i.e., the floors to the houses are not actually added).<br>

			<p>Polycarp plays “Game 23”. Initially he has a number n and his goal is to transform it to m. In one move, he can multiply n by 2 or multiply n by 3. He can perform any number of moves.</p>

<p>It is easy to prove that any way to transform n to m contains the same number of moves (i.e. number of moves doesn’t depend on the way of transformation).<br>

			<p>Alice has a birthday today, so she invited home her best friend Bob. Now Bob needs to find a way to commute to the Alice’s home.</p>
<p>In the city in which Alice and Bob live, the first metro line is being built. This metro line contains n<br>stations numbered from 1 to n. Bob lives near the station with number 1, while Alice lives near the station with number s. The metro line has two tracks. Trains on the first track go from the station 1 to the station n</p>
<p>and trains on the second track go in reverse direction. Just after the train arrives to the end of its track, it goes to the depot immediately, so it is impossible to travel on it after that.</p>
<p>Some stations are not yet open at all and some are only partially open — for each station and for each track it is known whether the station is closed for that track or not. If a station is closed for some track, all trains going in this track’s direction pass the station without stopping on it.</p>
<p>When the Bob got the information on opened and closed stations, he found that traveling by metro may be unexpectedly complicated. Help Bob determine whether he can travel to the Alice’s home by metro or he should search for some other transport.<br>

			<p>Little boy Valera studies an algorithm of sorting an integer array. After studying the theory, he went on to the practical tasks. As a result, he wrote a program that sorts an array of n integers a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, …, a<sub>n</sub> in the non-decreasing order. The pseudocode of the program, written by Valera, is given below. The input of the program gets number n and array a.</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">loop integer variable i from 1 to n - 1</span><br><span class="line">    loop integer variable j from i to n - 1</span><br><span class="line">        if (aj &gt; aj + 1), then swap the values of elements aj and aj + 1</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>But Valera could have made a mistake, because he hasn’t yet fully learned the sorting algorithm. If Valera made a mistake in his program, you need to give a counter-example that makes his program work improperly (that is, the example that makes the program sort the array not in the non-decreasing order). If such example for the given value of n doesn’t exist, print -1.<br>
