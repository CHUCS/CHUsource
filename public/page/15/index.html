			<p>Little Petya very much likes gifts. Recently he has received a new laptop as a New Year gift from his mother. He immediately decided to give it to somebody else as what can be more pleasant than giving somebody gifts. And on this occasion he organized a New Year party at his place and invited n his friends there.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing Petya likes more that receiving gifts, that’s watching others giving gifts to somebody else. Thus, he safely hid the laptop until the next New Year and made up his mind to watch his friends exchanging gifts while he does not participate in the process. He numbered all his friends with integers from 1 to n. Petya remembered that a friend number i gave a gift to a friend number p<sub>i</sub>. He also remembered that each of his friends received exactly one gift.</p>
<p>Now Petya wants to know for each friend i the number of a friend who has given him a gift.</p>

			<p>Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw n squares in the snow with a side length of 1. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length 1, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.</p>
<p>In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends (x,y)and (x,y+1). Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends (x′,y) and (x′,y+1) for some x′. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates x, x+1 and the differing coordinate y.</p>

			<p>Arkady invited Anna for a dinner to a sushi restaurant. The restaurant is a bit unusual: it offers n pieces of sushi aligned in a row, and a customer has to choose a continuous subsegment of these sushi to buy.</p>
<p>The pieces of sushi are of two types: either with tuna or with eel. Let’s denote the type of the i-th from the left sushi as t<sub>i</sub>, where t<sub>i</sub>=1 means it is with tuna, and t<sub>i</sub>=2 means it is with eel.</p>
<p>Arkady does not like tuna, Anna does not like eel. Arkady wants to choose such a continuous subsegment of sushi that it has equal number of sushi of each type and each half of the subsegment has only sushi of one type. For example, subsegment [2,2,2,1,1,1] is valid, but subsegment [1,2,1,2,1,2] is not, because both halves contain both types of sushi.</p>
<p>Find the length of the longest continuous subsegment of sushi Arkady can buy.</p>

			<p>Maxim always goes to the supermarket on Sundays. Today the supermarket has a special offer of discount systems.</p>
<p>There are m types of discounts. We assume that the discounts are indexed from 1 to m. To use the discount number i, the customer takes a special basket, where he puts exactly q<sub>i</sub> items he buys. Under the terms of the discount system, in addition to the items in the cart the customer can receive at most two items from the supermarket for free. The number of the “free items” (0, 1 or 2) to give is selected by the customer. The only condition imposed on the selected “free items” is as follows: each of them mustn’t be more expensive than the cheapest item out of the q<sub>i</sub> items in the cart.</p>
<p>Maxim now needs to buy n items in the shop. Count the minimum sum of money that Maxim needs to buy them, if he use the discount system optimally well.</p>
<p>Please assume that the supermarket has enough carts for any actions. Maxim can use the same discount multiple times. Of course, Maxim can buy items without any discounts.</p>

			<p>Sereja showed an interesting game to his friends. The game goes like that. Initially, there is a table with an empty cup and n water mugs on it. Then all players take turns to move. During a move, a player takes a non-empty mug of water and pours all water from it into the cup. If the cup overfills, then we assume that this player lost.</p>
<p>As soon as Sereja’s friends heard of the game, they wanted to play it. Sereja, on the other hand, wanted to find out whether his friends can play the game in such a way that there are no losers. You are given the volumes of all mugs and the cup. Also, you know that Sereja has (n - 1) friends. Determine if Sereja’s friends can play the game so that nobody loses. </p>
