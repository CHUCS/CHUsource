			<p>You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.</p>
<p>Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.</p>
<p>Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).</p>
<p>Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?</p>

			<p>A frog is currently at the point 0 on a coordinate axis Ox. It jumps by the following algorithm: the first jump is a units to the right, the second jump is b units to the left, the third jump is a units to the right, the fourth jump is b units to the left, and so on.</p>
<p>Formally:</p>
<blockquote>

			<p>Mad scientist Mike entertains himself by arranging rows of dominoes. He doesn’t need dominoes, though: he uses rectangular magnets instead. Each magnet has two poles, positive (a “plus”) and negative (a “minus”). If two magnets are put together at a close distance, then the like poles will repel each other and the opposite poles will attract each other.</p>
<p>Mike starts by laying one magnet horizontally on the table. During each following step Mike adds one more magnet horizontally to the right end of the row. Depending on how Mike puts the magnet on the table, it is either attracted to the previous one (forming a group of multiple magnets linked together) or repelled by it (then Mike lays this magnet at some distance to the right from the previous one). We assume that a sole magnet not linked to others forms a group of its own.<br><img src="A.PNG" alt="A"><br>Mike arranged multiple magnets in a row. Determine the number of groups that the magnets formed.</p>

			<p>Valeric and Valerko missed the last Euro football game, so they decided to watch the game’s key moments on the Net. They want to start watching as soon as possible but the connection speed is too low. If they turn on the video right now, it will “hang up” as the size of data to watch per second will be more than the size of downloaded data per second.</p>
<p>The guys want to watch the whole video without any pauses, so they have to wait some integer number of seconds for a part of the video to download. After this number of seconds passes, they can start watching. Waiting for the whole video to download isn’t necessary as the video can download after the guys started to watch.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose that video’s length is c seconds and Valeric and Valerko wait t seconds before the watching. Then for any moment of time t<sub>0</sub>, t ≤ t<sub>0</sub> ≤ c + t, the following condition must fulfill: the size of data received in t<sub>0</sub> seconds is not less than the size of data needed to watch t<sub>0</sub> - t seconds of the video.</p>
<p>Of course, the guys want to wait as little as possible, so your task is to find the minimum integer number of seconds to wait before turning the video on. The guys must watch the video without pauses.</p>

			<p>Ilya is a very clever lion, he lives in an unusual city ZooVille. In this city all the animals have their rights and obligations. Moreover, they even have their own bank accounts. The state of a bank account is an integer. The state of a bank account can be a negative number. This means that the owner of the account owes the bank money.</p>
<p>Ilya the Lion has recently had a birthday, so he got a lot of gifts. One of them (the gift of the main ZooVille bank) is the opportunity to delete the last digit or the digit before last from the state of his bank account no more than once. For example, if the state of Ilya’s bank account is -123, then Ilya can delete the last digit and get his account balance equal to -12, also he can remove its digit before last and get the account balance equal to -13. Of course, Ilya is permitted not to use the opportunity to delete a digit from the balance.</p>
<p>Ilya is not very good at math, and that’s why he asks you to help him maximize his bank account. Find the maximum state of the bank account that can be obtained using the bank’s gift.</p>
